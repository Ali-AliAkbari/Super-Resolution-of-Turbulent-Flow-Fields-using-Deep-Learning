# üåÄ Super-Resolution of Turbulent Flow Fields using Deep Learning

This repository presents an implementation of a super-resolution neural network inspired by the methodology proposed in:

> **B. Hu et al.,**  
> *Super-resolution-assisted rapid high-fidelity CFD modeling of data centers*,  
> *Building and Environment*, Volume 247, 2024, 111036.  
> [DOI: 10.1016/j.buildenv.2023.111036](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2023.111036)

We apply their idea of reconstructing high-resolution flow fields from low-resolution CFD data to a **turbulent flow dataset**. The model learns to map coarse CFD data to finer-resolution outputs using a U-Net-like architecture enhanced with residual blocks.

## üìå Key Contributions

- Implementation of a deep CNN for super-resolution of 2D turbulent fluid flow fields.
- Adaptation of the concept from data center cooling to a general-purpose turbulence dataset.
- Visualization and evaluation of predicted vs. ground truth fields.
- Use of `torchviz` for model structure visualization.
- Use of normalized preprocessing, residual connections, and skip connections in a U-Net architecture.

## üß† Inspiration

The methodology is based on this figure from the original paper:

Our network aims to perform a similar super-resolution task, adapted for 2D incompressible turbulence flows.

## üóÇ Dataset

We used:
- Low-resolution irregular CFD data: [`kmflow_sampled_data_irregnew.npz`](https://figshare.com/ndownloader/files/39214622)
- High-resolution field data: [`kf_2d_re1000_256_40seed.npy`](https://figshare.com/ndownloader/files/39181919)

These datasets contain velocity field slices of 2D turbulent flow simulations.

## üß± Network Architecture

The network consists of:
- Initial convolution layer
- **Downsampling path**: residual blocks with max pooling
- **Bottleneck**: deep residual learning
- **Upsampling path**: transposed convolutions + skip connections
- Final output convolution

## üîß Training Setup

- Loss: `MSELoss` (optionally `L1Loss`)
- Optimizer: `Adam` with learning rate decay using `ReduceLROnPlateau`
- Framework: PyTorch
- Hardware: GPU or CPU-compatible

```python
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=1e-5)
scheduler = optim.lr_scheduler.ReduceLROnPlateau(optimizer, 'min')
criterion = nn.MSELoss()


Training for 40 epochs (20+20) with gradient clipping and adaptive learning rate scheduling.

## üìä Example Outputs

Here is a comparison between:
- **LR input** (coarse CFD result)
- **SR output** (predicted high-resolution)
- **Ground truth** (actual CFD result)

The model successfully reconstructs fine-scale features missing from the low-resolution input.
